\section{Implementation}

The active walker model was previously implemented by \citet{trailsystems}. We further developed the model by adding the path-evaluation function and the interface to work with real elevation data to its functionalities. The implementation by \citet{trailsystems} is described in their report, while our contribution is described here.

\subsection{Interface for real Elevation Data}

The elevation data provided by swisstopo.admin.ch (5$\times$5 $km$ for each site) came in a resolution of 25$\times$25 $m$. To use this elevation data in our model first the resolution had to to be lowered to 500$\times$500 $m$ for computational reasons and then the data had to bee adjusted to work in our model. 


\subsection{Path Class}
As our
