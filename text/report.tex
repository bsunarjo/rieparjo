Code was developed in team work. Christoph focused on the model itself, while Benjamin focused on visualization of results and building test cases. Appropriately, for the report, Christoph focused on the description and implementation of the model, while Benjamin focused on simulation results.

\section{Introduction}
%=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

%(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
%(Add real-world examples, if any)
%(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

Agent-based models can provide a easily implementable way to study complex systems. As \citet{helbing:1997} have shown, many aspects of pedestrian motion, such as the formation of trail systems in green areas, can be reproduced using a relatively simple ``active walker'' model that takes into account the attractiveness of terrain and feedback on the terrain as it is walked upon. In the current project, we plan to apply such an active walker model to real landscapes and compare the results to existing road systems.



%(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
%(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )
%(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.)

We attempt to answer the question: is the active walker model able to predict reasonable pathways between neighboring villages in real landscapes? Here, ``reasonable'' will be evaluated first in a qualitative sense. Second, a energy function will be defined based on the distance traveled horizontally and vertically, where a minimal energy function is most reasonable.

In a second step, we will determine the influence of landscape slope on trail formation, under the assumption that modern roads are situated where historically trails used to go through. We will compare generated paths to current road networks at two test sites to answer the questions: How does trail formation change with increasing landscape slope? Do the formed paths fit to current road networks?

Theoretical work by \citet{helbing:1997} has previously been implemented in an agent-based model by \citet{trailsystems}. We will base our investigation of the above research questions on this model, making adjustments where necessary. We will use topographical data from swisstopo.admin.ch with an emphasis on 1. determining reasonable model parameters and 2. comparing modeled trails to existing road systems. Two test sites are proposed, one in an mountainous region in St. Moritz, the other in the Swiss lowlands near Friburg (Figure~\ref{fig:site}). These two test sites provide very different types of terrain on which to study the problem of trail formation.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/site}
	\caption{The two study sites: a relatively flat region around Fribourg and a more mountainous region around St. Moritz. Coordinates are given as latitude/longitude in WGS84.}
	\label{fig:site}
\end{figure}

We expect to find that the smaller roads correspond more closely to results generated by the active walker model, while larger cantonal roads, being further removed from their trail origins, should correspond less with model results. We further expect increasingly mountainous terrain to tightly constrain possible routes: we expect closer correlation between road systems and generated model results in mountainous regions than in the lowlands, since there are less possibilities for taking a route with low associated energy cost.

\section{Simulation Results and Discussion}
%=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
In our analysis of the path formation process using our active walker model, the biggest uncertainty concerned the values of the various independent parameters (durability and intensity of trails, visibility, relative importance of the destination vector). No literature values could be found for these parameters (they are dependent on model specifics such as the model scale). Since our initial hypotheses cannot be conclusively addressed without dealing with the issue of model parameters, we first discuss the effects parameter variation has on model results. We then compare our results with existing road structures.

%=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
\subsection{Parameter variation}
A systematic parameter variation study was performed. The two test sites were set up with fixed destinations corresponding to the largest cities in the area. An appropriate range of possible values was chosen for each of the four independent model parameters and the model run for 100 steps for each possible parameter combination. 

\subsubsection{Visibility}
\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/visibility}
	\caption{The effect of the visibility parameter on attractiveness structure. At low visibilities, the attractiveness reflects the terrain, whereas at high visibilities agents focus more on their destination and terrain details are lost.}
	\label{fig:vis}
\end{figure}
Unfortunately, due to a {\sc matlab} error, the visibility parameter could not be systematically analyzed. The following discussion is therefore of a qualitative nature. As described in \autoref{trail_potential}, visibility controls how fast the influence of an agent's surroundings decreases with distance. As can be seen in \autoref{fig:vis}, a higher visibility causes the attractiveness to ``soften'': the terrain details present at a visibility of 0.3 are lost at a visibility of 4. This causes the agent to consider a larger area in his decision, resulting in a more efficient path taken. Also, paths resulting paths may be more diverse, as different paths have similar efficiency when viewed over a large area rather than simply in the immediate vicinity.

\subsubsection{Importance}
As described in \autoref{pedestrians_direction}, the importance parameter controls how the destination is weighted against an agent's preference for walking in the most attractive direction. A higher importance causes the destination vector to be weighed more heavily, whereas a lower importance causes the attractiveness vector to be weighed more heavily. In \autoref{table:importance1}, the average number of completed paths (agents having reached their destination) after 100 model steps is listed. As might be expected, a higher importance results in significantly more agents reaching their destination. If the importance is lower, agents wander around in the direction where walking is easiest, never reaching their destination (\autoref{fig:importance}). It is difficult, however, to determine what value of importance is the ``correct'' one. Real agents may prefer taking a detour if it means they can walk more comfortably. Also, \autoref{table:importance2} indicates that \emph{when} agents manage to reach their destination, their travel times don't vary considerably. However, all-in-all, since considerably more agents manage to reach their destination within the timespan of 100 model steps when importance is high, this can be considered the more efficient system.
